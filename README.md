SlashTHEM
=====================

SlashTHEM is a another Nethack variant.  In particular, it takes after Slash'EM and an earlier version of Slash'EM Extended.  I consider it more of a Slash'EM variant at this point since it's far more in line with that rather than Extended.

A changelog of SlashTHEM can be found [here] (https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Current Status
--------------

I very rarely come back to this project. Only times I work on it now is when I get the urge to play it, honestly.  There's plenty of bugs that exist, but for the most part there shouldn't be any crashes or the like.  Consider it dormant, essentially.

The source code builds fine on Windows using MinGW, as well as Linux.  Other Operating Systems are untested.  I highly doubt it runs on legacy systems however (VMS, Amiga, etc.)

Windows (x64) builds are available on the [releases] (https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/releases) page.
