SlashTHEM
=====================

SlashTHEM is a another Nethack variant.  In particular, it takes after Slash'EM and an earlier version of Slash'EM Extended.  I consider it more of a Slash'EM variant at this point since it's far more in line with that rather than Extended.

A changelog of SlashTHEM can be found [here] (https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).  A changelog of the current codebase can be found [here](CHANGELOG-NG.md) although it's a tad out of date.

Current Status
--------------

I very rarely come back to this project. Only times I work on it now is when I get the urge to play it, honestly.  There's plenty of bugs that exist, but for the most part there _shouldn't_ be any crashes or the like.  Consider it dormant, essentially.  Plus, there's plenty of other (better) variants out there to play.  If you must play Slash'EM you could go vanilla, or:

- [Slash'EM Next](https://github.com/moon-chilled/slashem-next), if you want Slash'EM + Curses Interface + Unicode + a much more coherient codebase.
- [Slash'EM Extended](https://github.com/SLASHEM-Extended/SLASHEM-Extended), if you want a variant that includes absolutely everything and every possible idea, good and bad.
- [Slash'EM-Upgrades and Patches](https://github.com/BarclayII/slashem-up/tree/develop), if you want Slash'EM + Balance changes, a few backports from Nethack 3.6, various upgrades and integrated patches.

The source code builds fine on Windows using MinGW, as well as Linux.  Other Operating Systems are untested.  I highly doubt it runs on legacy systems however (VMS, Amiga, etc.)

Windows (x64) builds are available on the [releases] (https://github.com/Soviet5lo/SlashTHEM/releases) page, but these are very much out of date compared to the current code.
