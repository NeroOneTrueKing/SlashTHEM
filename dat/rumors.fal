Freshly slain corpses stack inconsistently: Say there is a stale stack of corpses on your altar.
A way of making the fresh corpses created not get 'oldified' by the existing stale stack is to blind yourself when killing the new puddings.
Somehow this causes the newly generated corpses to be in a different stack.
Moving with the m or HJ... commands into a warning symbol attacks (and stones you if applicable) if and only if it does not cover up an I known from previous searching or movement.
Things are even more complicated if you are blind, or if there are invisible monsters you can't see.

Standing on a drawbridge is safe! Monsters are coded to never zap a wand of striking because they know that would kill you!

You should never disable autopickup, since it allows you to grab cockatrice corpses without having to waste a turn!

With a levitation spell, Medusa's island becomes much easier, even if you're unskilled or restricted.
Some statues in the Gnomish Mines can animate if you step on them, but on such shallow levels, they never represent dangerous monsters anyway.
Using a pet gremlin is a great way to kill Medusa because he will multiply, creating hundreds of gremlins to take her down!

Don't worry, no enemy in this game is intelligent enough to zap striking at you while standing on an altar with a stack of water underneath you.
Annoyed by battle spam? Just skip everything using the space bar! The game will notify you if something happens to you or your cockatrice corpse.
Zapping polymorph at a filled chest is a great way to transform a box into a bag, which can even be one of holding.
Zapping polymorph at a filled chest will always transform it into another container, because otherwise the contents would be lost.

If you have (nearly) maxed out your protection, it's a good time to pray for unholy water on a crossaligned altar.
If you fall past Medusa through a trap door, don't worry. You can just go back up and get a guaranteed method of crossing water.
Meleeing cockatrices while polymorphed into a mind flayer isn't dangerous; your polymorphed form won't use attacks that touch the cockatrice directly.
Polymorphing an annoying monster to get it out of your way will never transform it into something more dangerous.

If a fountain in Minetown reduces to a trickle, it means you should continue using it.
The gnome with a wand of death will only spawn if you're magic resistant anyway.

Arch-liches are less likely to use the touch of death against a non-resistant player if you step off your Elbereth square.
If you're trying weaponless conduct, you can still use pick-axes to dig.
If you're trying pacifist conduct, just be bare-handed at all times and move by using the arrow keys.

The game will warn you if you're about to sacrifice your pet, so you can't do so accidentally.
Did the Medusa fight make you hungry? Just eat something while standing over her corpse. Eating her corpse gives stoning resistance, by the way.
Shapechanging enemies can be safely ignored. They won't turn into dangerous monsters unless you provoke them.

A shapechanging monster will never turn into a black dragon on Gnomish Mines level 2, as you probably won't have reflection yet.

Using stone to flesh on bones level statues will turn them into powerful pets that will help you clear out the level.
If a human zombie dies on your altar during a sacfest, just sacrifice its corpse and it will be gone.
Seeing messages related to a swamp doesn't mean danger. Swamp water isn't deep enough, so the eels can't drown you.

Throwing food at a peaceful dragon can tame it if you're lucky.

When you solve a Sokoban level and open the door at the end of the hall, there will only be one or two monsters there. If any.
A nymph who stole a wand of death from you on a no-teleport level won't use it against you, since the programmers don't want you to die in such a stupid way.

Don't fight Master Kaen with regular weapons. Use a Kaensbane instead, e.g. a thoroughly corroded thoroughly rusty tin opener.
