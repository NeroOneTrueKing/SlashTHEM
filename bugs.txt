All known bugs

* Character selection menu doesn't allow selecting some roles (letters being used improperly)
* Some letters bleed over into the sidelines while maximized?
* HP/PW don't show when not using classic_status (instead its just ---)
* Any status effects remain on screen even after they expire.
* Immediate segfault when saving and then restoring in an attempt to fix the above problem.
* Hitpointbar works really wonky with curses.

Helpful enhancements

* Any/all fixes from the ports in SlashEM9/Nethack36/Unnethack.  This might not be easy considering the original patch for Slash'EM remained in alpha and these three projects have deviated quite a bit from what's being used here.
